# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is a function? Why would you use one?

  Your answer: A function is a tiny machine within your code. It takes inputs and gives an output using logic. A function can be run and rerun as many times you want in your code. Functions are used when you want to do a task over and over again without recoding everything in the function over and over.

  Researched answer: A function in Javascript is a small section of code or a set of statements that does a specific task. A function is like a procedure, which is a piece of code that you can reuse over and over. However, while a procedure is just a set of directions that are performed in order, a function is used to return an output or value from an input passed into it. One reason you would use a function is to avoid repeating code in your source code. When you have a task that you want to perform at different parts of your source code, you can remove repeated code and create a function that you can call from that part of the source code instead. 



2. In regards to functions, what is the difference between an argument and a parameter?

  Your answer: In a function, a parameter is a placeholder put inside the parentheses at the beginning of a function. An argument is the data that you put inside the parentheses when you call the function elsewhere in the code. The argument corresponds to the parameter in that whatever data you input as the argument replaces the placeholder of the parameter in the logic of the function.

  Researched answer:  In a function, a parameter is a placeholder or variable which is put inside the parentheses at the beginning of a function. The beginning of a function is called the declaration of the function. When the function is called elsewhere in the code, you pass data called an argument into the parentheses of the called function. The argument is the value of the variable which is the parameter.



3. What is an index? What is the difference between index and value?

  Your answer: An index is the location of the data within an array. The difference between an index and a value is that, while an index is the location of the data within an array, a value is what that data actually is. Each piece of data in an array is called a value. The location of that value within the array is the index. The index of the values are zero indexed, meaning that the index of the first value is zero.

  Researched answer: An index is a property of arrays. An array is a set of storage places. An index is used as a reference to the location of each storage place. The content of each storage location is known as an element. The value is the content of each element. Arrays in Javascript are zero indexed, which means that the index of the first element in an array is 0. Strings in Javascript are also zero indexed. You can find the index of a character in a string or each element in an array using built-in methods like indexOf().



4. What is a built-in method?

  Your answer: Built-in methods are built in functions of Javascript that are used often by developers. They have been put into Javascript so developers don't need to build them themselves every time they are working on new code. Like regular functions, sometimes built-in methods take arguments that are run through the function of the built-in method in the background.

  Researched answer: A method is a property of an object that is a function. A property is a thing that an object has, and a method is an action that an object performs. Methods are called like functions, but are attatched to objects using a dot operator. Sometimes built-in methods have parentheses to take an argument like regular functions. However, some built-in methods don't take arguments. If you access a method that takes an argument without the parentheses, it will return the function definition instead of performing an action.



5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

  Your answer: Pair programming is when two developers help each other when they are working together on the same code. Each of the two developers are assigned a certain role while coding. One developer is the Driver, while the other developer is the Navigator. The Driver is the one who writes the code while working on the computer. The Navigator is the one who verbally communicates what the Driver should be coding. The Navigator helps by verbally explaining what the code should do and how it should work. The Driver takes the instructions from the Navigator and implements them into the code. The two developers will switch roles often so they each can get a better grasp of the code and learn from one another.

  Researched answer: Pair programming is when two developers work at the same computer while working on a project together. Each of the two developers are assigned a certain role while coding. One developer is the Driver, while the other developer is the Navigator, also called the Observer. The Driver is the one who writes the code while working on the computer. The Navigator watches the Driver code and checks their work on each line as its being typed. The Navigator also helps by thinking about how to approach the code, verbally explaining what the code should do and how it should work, and brainstorming ideas for ways to improve the code. This is done to help the Driver focus on coding and completing the project, using the Navigator as a director. The two developers swtich roles often so they can each get a better grasp of the code and learn from one another. While the Driver is coding, the Navigator should not also be coding so they can help the driver think things out. The Driver and Navigator should be in constant communication with each other, if the Driver doesn't understand something they should talk it out between the two of them. The Driver should also occasionally stop coding and make sure the Navigator isn't being left behind.



6. What is something we did in class this week you found helpful?  

  Your answer: I think pair programming was the most helpful thing this week. Not only did I get help understanding certain concepts from coders who knew more than I did, but I was able to retain information more when I was the one who had to reiterate the concepts to someone else. I found it immensely helpful and valuable. I look forward to more pair programming in the future.



## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Iteration: An iteration is a piece of code that will run over and over until a specific condition happens. An example of an iteration in Javascript is a loop. In an iteration of a loop, the code will run over and over as long as a certain condition is true. Once the condition is false, the iteration will end.

2. Higher Order Functions: A higher order funciton is a function where another function is passed into the function as an argument or a function where another function is the output.

3. Jest: Jest is a Javascript testing framework that is maintained by Facebook. It is designed to ensure correctness of any Javascript code. It is essentially a Javascript test runner, or a library of Javascript for creating, running and structuring tests in Javascript.

4. Classes: Classes are a type of function that act as the instructions for creating objects. They encapsulate data with code to work on that data, and functions that manipulate data.

5. React: React is a free and open-source front-end library for javascript that is used for building user interfaces or user interface components for webpages, mobile webpages, or other mobile apps.
